# Build Something Real With Claude

You're going to build and deploy your own app today. Claude is going to be your partner through the whole thing.

You don't need programming experience. You don't need to know what frameworks or APIs are. You just need an idea—even a vague one—and a willingness to have a conversation.

## What You Need

Before you start, you'll need:

- **A Claude Pro account** - Claude Code requires a Pro subscription. If you don't have one, sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (there's a free trial available)
- **A computer** - Mac, Windows, or Linux
- **An internet connection** - For installing tools and using APIs

That's it! Everything else will be installed as you go.

## Get Started

There are two setup steps. You'll use Claude (the chat at claude.ai) to help you through both of them.

### Step 1: Install Claude Code

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and ask:

> "I need to install Claude Code on my computer. Can you walk me through it step by step?"

Claude will figure out what kind of computer you have and guide you through the installation. Follow along until Claude Code is installed and working.

### Step 2: Clone This Repo and Open It

Once Claude Code is installed, ask Claude:

> "I need to clone this repo and open it in Claude Code: https://github.com/joeunion/claude_code_101"

Claude will walk you through cloning the repo and opening Claude Code in the right folder.

### Step 3: Start

Once Claude Code is open in this folder, type:

> "I'm ready to start."

Claude Code will take it from there.

---

If you get stuck at any point during the experience, you can always start a new Claude Code conversation in this folder and say "I'm picking up where I left off." Claude will read your files and figure out where you are.

If you're truly stuck, email joe@union.studio.
